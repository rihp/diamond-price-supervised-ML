# Predicting the sale price of a Diamond

### Can a machine learning algorithm guess the price of a diamond based on its features?

In this case, we have participated in a private Kaggle Competition, which consisted in estimating the price of a diamond, based on the following **features**:

-  `id`: only for test & sample submission files, id for prediction sample identification
- `price`: price in USD
- `carat`: weight of the diamond
- `cut`: quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)
- `color`: diamond colour, from J (worst) to D (best)
- `clarity`: a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))
- `x`: length in mm
- `y`: width in mm
-  `z`: depth in mm
- `depth`: total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43--79)
- `table`: width of top of diamond relative to widest point (43--95)
